(1) Dashboard Tabs

  * ```PROJECTS```: Existing projects (own projects, or projects that have been shared by other users) can be accessed and managed, and new projects can be created. Each project is represented by a card.
  * ```TUTORIALS```: A set of pre-built read-only tutorial projects with results is available to all **_S4L_<sup>_lite_</sup>** users. When a tutorial is selected, a copy is automatically created and added to the user’s ```Projects``` tab. This new copy is editable.

(2) Dashboard Buttons

  * Three buttons (from left to right): to open Dashboard Manual; to open the user forum (https://forum.zmt.swiss) and to contact the **_S4L_<sup>_lite_</sup>** support team via email (s4l-support@zmt.swiss); to change the color scheme between light and dark themes.
  * A menu with the following entities:
    * ```Preferences```: Access to Profile, Security, Confirmation, Tag, and Organization settings.
    * ```Organization```: Direct access to Organization settings.
