If Sim4Life:web *lite* needs updating, a small circular arrow sign will appear in the bottom right corner of the Card on the **Dashboard**. Clicking this icon will bring you directly to the update menu where you see the current and newest available version where you can update. Regarding sharing functionality deserves [a separation section](/docs/platform_introduction/dashboard/sharing.md).

Once a project is opened, it is always possible to return to the _**Dashboard**_ by clicking the ```Dashboard``` button on the top left, which automatically saves the state of the currently opened plan.
