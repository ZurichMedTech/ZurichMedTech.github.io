### Dashboard

The **Dashboard** hosts the two principal views: ```Projects``` and ```Tutorials``` (1.).

</p>

- Under ```Projects```, existing projects (own projects, or projects that have been shared by other users) can be accessed (3.) and managed (4.), and new Plans can be [created](docs/platform_introduction/dashboard/new_project.md). 
- Under ```Tutorials```, the existing Tutorials can be managed and downloaded (see [Tutorials](/docs/platform_introduction/dashboard/tutorials.md)).

Use the Porject Search Filter (2.) to filter the projects or tutotials. This search bar supports filtering by string, name, keywords or tags (just click on the text field to drop down a list of available categories).

In addition, buttons on the top right provide access to this user manual, switching between a dark and a light theme, and a menu (5.) with the following entries:
- _**Preferences**_: Access to **_Profile_**, **_Security_**, **_Confirmations_**, **_Tag_**, and **_Organization_** settings
- _**Organization**_: Direct access to **_Organization_** settings
- _**Quick Start**_: A short **Quick Start** guide, which is also displayed the first time the Sim4Life-Lite is accessed
- _**License**_: Information about the Sim4Life-Lite license, as well as the licenses of the underlying technologies
- _**About**_: List of **Front-end** and **Back-end** technologies employed by the Sim4Life-Lite
- _**Logout**_: Logging out from the **Sim4Life-Lite**

#### Manage Study

The user can access more functionality such as **_Project data_**, **_Sharing_**, **_Duplicate_** and **_More options_** through the ellipsis (1.) menu button. If Sim4Life-Lite needs updating, a small circular arrow sign will appear in the bottom right corner (2.) of the Card on the **Dashboard**. Clicking this icon will bring you directly to the update menu where you see the current and newest available version where you can update. Regarding sharing functionality deserves [a separation section](/docs/platform_introduction/dashboard/sharing.md).

Once a project is opened, it is always possible to return to the _**Dashboard**_ by clicking the ```Dashboard``` button on the top left, which automatically saves the state of the currently opened plan.
