### Dashboard

The **Dashboard** hosts the two principal views: ```Projects``` and ```Tutorials``` (1.).

- Under ```Projects```, existing Plans (own Plans, or plans that have been shared by other users) can be accessed (3.) and managed (4.), and new Plans can be [created](docs/plan/create_new_plan.md). 
- Under ```Tutorials```, the existing Tutorials can be managed and downloaded (see [Tutorials](/docs/platform_introduction/Tutorials.md)).

In addition, buttons on the top right provide access to this user manual, switching between a dark and a light theme, and a menu (5.) with the following entries:
- _**Preferences**_: Access to **Profile**, **_Security_**, **_API_**, **_UI_**, **_Confirmations_**, **_Tag_**, and **_Organization_** settings (see the [o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC User Manual](https://docs.osparc.io/#/) for detailed information)
- _**Quick Start**_: A short **Quick Start** guide, which is also displayed the first time the Sim4Life-Lite is accessed.
- _**License**_: Information about the Sim4Life-Lite license, as well as the licenses of the underlying technologies.
- _**About**_: List of **Front-end** and **Back-end** technologies employed by the Sim4Life-Lite
- _**Logout**_: Logging out from the **Sim4Life-Lite**

The user access more functionality such as **_Plan management_**, **_information_**, **_sharing_**, and **_Service overview and update_** (3.) through the three-dot menu (1.) icon (see the [o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC User Manual](https://docs.osparc.io/#/) for information on these functionalities as well as the locking states). 
If Services within a Plan need updating, the small circular arrow sign will appear in the bottom right corner (2.) of the Plan
on the **Dashboard**. Clicking this icon will bring you directly to the update menu where you see the current and newest available
versions of each Service and where you can update them either individually or all together.

It is always possible to return to the _**Dashboard**_ by clicking the ```Dashboard``` button on the top left, which automatically saves the state of the currently opened plan.
