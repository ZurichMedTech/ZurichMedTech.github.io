## Platform Overview

The Sim4Life-Lite has the following principal views:
* a [Landing Page](/docs/platform_introduction/overview.md), which currently serves primarily for user authentication.
* a [Dashboard](/docs/platform_introduction/dashboard/dashboard.md) that provides an overview of a user's projects and permits to launch the creation of a new project.
* a [Sim4Life-Lite](/docs/platform_introduction/s4l_lite.md), where you can run simulations, combining computable human phantoms with the most powerful physics solvers and the most advanced tissue models, for directly analyzing biological real-world phenomena.
