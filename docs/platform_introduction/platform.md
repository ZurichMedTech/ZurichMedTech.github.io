# Platform Overview

The **Sim4Life:web** *lite* has the following principal views:
* [Landing Page](/docs/platform_introduction/overview.md), which currently serves primarily for user authentication.
* [Dashboard](/docs/platform_introduction/dashboard/dashboard.md), that provides an overview of a user's projects, and pre-built read-only tutorial projects and permits the user to create a new project or open a tutorial project.
* [**Sim4Life:web** *lite*](/docs/platform_introduction/s4l_lite.md), where the user performs all steps in complex multiphysics modeling, from defining the problem in a parametric 3D modeling environment, discretizing, simulating, and analyzing to visualizing the results.
