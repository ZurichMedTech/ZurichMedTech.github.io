### Landing Page

</p>

The Landing Page currently serves primarily for user authentication. Two-factor authentication is required:
- a user name (email address) and password
- an SMS is sent to user's mobile phone number that provides the required one-time 4-digit pin.
- if there is any problem with the SMS code, you can request it via email

An account can be requested and created directly through the _**Create Account**_ link on this page, by providing an email address and setting a password. If the user cannot remember the password of an existing account, it can be reset through the _**Forgot Password**_ link.
