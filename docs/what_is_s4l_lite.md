### *The power of the **Sim4Life** simulation platform, boosted by its revolutionary web interface!*

<br>

**_S4L_<sup>_lite_</sup>** is a powerful multi-physics simulation platform that allows students to easily access, run and share simulations in the cloud from any web browser. It offers the same features and performance as the desktop version but is more flexible, maintenance-free and easier to use. It does not require powerful in-house computational resources as it relies on AWSâ€™s virtually unlimited cloud-computing infrastructure thus 

The access to **_S4L_<sup>_lite_</sup>** is available free of charge to students enrolled at registered universities.

> **_NOTE:_** Existing **Sim4Life light** desktop users can easily create an account and start using **_S4L_<sup>_lite_</sup>** immediately on the browser without any installation. The simulation files generated using the desktop version are fully compatible and can be smoothly migrated in the **_S4L_<sup>_lite_</sup>** platform by simply uploading them to the online platform.

All modeling capabilities from the segmentation of medical image data, anatomical and CAD model import, discretization and simulation to visualization and analysis are embedded and streamlined to offer the most versatile and efficient simulation environment possible.

At the core of Sim4Life are the computable, high-fidelity 3D Virtual Population (ViP) human anatomical models. Carefully selected to fully represent global variations in human anatomy, the fully posable, morphable, and validated ViP models along with the IT'IS tissue properties database depict 15 different body types with 120 vital anatomical features and over 300 precisely identified tissues and organs. Cited and applied in hundreds of published studies and papers, the ViP models and the IT'IS material parameter database are continually and meticulously updated, refined, and expanded. -->
