All modeling capabilities from the segmentation of medical image data, anatomical and CAD model import, discretization and simulation to visualization and analysis are embedded and streamlined to offer the most versatile and efficient simulation environment possible.

At the core of Sim4Life are the computable, high-fidelity 3D Virtual Population (ViP) human anatomical models. Carefully selected to fully represent global variations in human anatomy, the fully posable, morphable, and validated ViP models along with the IT'IS tissue properties database depict 15 different body types with 120 vital anatomical features and over 300 precisely identified tissues and organs. Cited and applied in hundreds of published studies and papers, the ViP models and the IT'IS material parameter database are continually and meticulously updated, refined, and expanded. -->
