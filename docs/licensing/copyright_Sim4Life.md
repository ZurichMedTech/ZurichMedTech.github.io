13.2 Customer may give access to Confidential Information only to its employees and students and only on a need-to-know basis. Customer shall use all due care to keep Confidential Information confidential.  
13.3 The obligations set out in this clause 13 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

15\. Termination  
15.1 This Agreement and all Licences granted hereunder may be terminated with immediate effect:  
15.1.1 by ZMT if Customer fails to pay any sums due under this Agreement for more than thirty (30) days after such sum becomes due and payable, provided that ZMT has once reminded Customer of the default;  
15.1.2 by either Party if any breach or non-performance of the Agreement by the other Party affecting the first Party to such a degree that continuation of the Agreement can in good faith no longer be expected.  
15.2 Upon termination of this Agreement, the Licence shall be terminated. Clause 7.4 above shall apply. Customer may not claim reimbursement of Licence Fees and Support Charges not used at the time of termination.  
  
  
16\. Miscellaneous  
16.1 Assignment: Customer shall not assign or transfer the Licence or this Agreement as a whole or in part to any third party without the prior express and written consent of ZMT.  
16.2 Entire Agreement: The Invoice and these Terms and Conditions encompass the entire understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement; there are no representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or collateral understandings other than expressly set forth in the Invoice and in these Terms and Conditions.  
16.3 Order and Invoice: In the event of differences between Customer's order and the Invoice, the Invoice shall prevail.  
16.4 Waivers: Any waiver of any right of ZMT under this Agreement shall only be effective if expressly communicated by ZMT to Customer in writing, with reference to this Agreement.  
16.5 Severability: If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, the invalid or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a valid and enforceable provision having a legal and economic effect which will be as similar as possible to the invalid or unenforceable provision.

As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.  
  
  
"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.  
  
  
An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.  
  
  
A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".  
  
  
The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.  
  
  
The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.  
  
  
1\. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.  
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.  
  
  
2\. Conveying Modified Versions.  
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:  
  
  
a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or  
b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.  
3\. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.  
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:  
  
  
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.  
b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.  
4\. Combined Works.  
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:  
  
  
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.  
b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.  
c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.  
d) Do one of the following:  
0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.  
1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.  
e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)  
5\. Combined Libraries.  
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:  
  
  
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.  
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.  
6\. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.  
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  
  
  
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.  
  
  
If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

1\. License Agreement for NVIDIA Software Development Kits  
\---------------------------------------------------------  
  
  
  
  
Important Notice—Read before downloading, installing,  
copying or using the licensed software:  
\-------------------------------------------------------  
  
  
This license agreement, including exhibits attached  
("Agreement") is a legal agreement between you and NVIDIA  
Corporation ("NVIDIA") and governs your use of a NVIDIA  
software development kit ("SDK").  
  
  
Each SDK has its own set of software and materials, but here  
is a description of the types of items that may be included in  
a SDK: source code, header files, APIs, data sets and assets  
(examples include images, textures, models, scenes, videos,  
native API input/output files), binary software, sample code,  
libraries, utility programs, programming code and  
documentation.  
  
  
This Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age  
of majority in the country in which the SDK is used.  
  
  
If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company  
or other legal entity, you represent that you have the legal  
authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, in which case  
"you" will mean the entity you represent.  
  
  
If you don’t have the required age or authority to accept  
this Agreement, or if you don’t accept all the terms and  
conditions of this Agreement, do not download, install or use  
the SDK.  
  
  
You agree to use the SDK only for purposes that are permitted  
by (a) this Agreement, and (b) any applicable law, regulation  
or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant  
jurisdictions.  
  
  
  
  
1.1. License  
  
  
  
  
1.1.1. License Grant  
  
  
Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants  
you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the  
right to sublicense (except as expressly provided in this  
Agreement) to:  
  
  
1\. Install and use the SDK,  
  
  
2\. Modify and create derivative works of sample source code  
delivered in the SDK, and  
  
  
3\. Distribute those portions of the SDK that are identified  
in this Agreement as distributable, as incorporated in  
object code format into a software application that meets  
the distribution requirements indicated in this Agreement.  
  
  
  
  
1.1.2. Distribution Requirements  
  
  
These are the distribution requirements for you to exercise  
the distribution grant:  
  
  
1\. Your application must have material additional  
functionality, beyond the included portions of the SDK.  
  
  
2\. The distributable portions of the SDK shall only be  
accessed by your application.  
  
  
3\. The following notice shall be included in modifications  
and derivative works of sample source code distributed:  
"This software contains source code provided by NVIDIA  
Corporation."  
  
  
4\. Unless a developer tool is identified in this Agreement  
as distributable, it is delivered for your internal use  
only.  
  
  
5\. The terms under which you distribute your application  
must be consistent with the terms of this Agreement,  
including (without limitation) terms relating to the  
license grant and license restrictions and protection of  
NVIDIA’s intellectual property rights. Additionally, you  
agree that you will protect the privacy, security and  
legal rights of your application users.  
  
  
6\. You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or  
suspected distribution or use of the SDK not in compliance  
with the requirements of this Agreement, and to enforce  
the terms of your agreements with respect to distributed  
SDK.  
  
  
  
  
1.1.3. Authorized Users  
  
  
You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of  
your subsidiary(ies) to access and use the SDK from your  
secure network to perform work on your behalf.  
  
  
If you are an academic institution you may allow users  
enrolled or employed by the academic institution to access and  
use the SDK from your secure network.  
  
  
You are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this  
Agreement by your authorized users. If you become aware that  
your authorized users didn’t follow the terms of this  
Agreement, you agree to take reasonable steps to resolve the  
non-compliance and prevent new occurrences.  
  
  
  
  
1.1.4. Pre-Release SDK  
  
  
The SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or  
otherwise as pre-release, may not be fully functional, may  
contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or  
different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and  
reliability standards relative to commercial versions of  
NVIDIA software and materials. Use of a pre-release SDK may  
result in unexpected results, loss of data, project delays or  
other unpredictable damage or loss.  
  
  
You may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding  
that pre-release SDKs are not intended for use in production  
or business-critical systems.  
  
  
NVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version  
of any pre-release SDK. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon  
development and terminate the availability of a pre-release  
SDK at any time without liability.  
  
  
  
  
1.1.5. Updates  
  
  
NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds  
or other updates to this SDK. Unless the updates are provided  
with their separate governing terms, they are deemed part of  
the SDK licensed to you as provided in this Agreement. You  
agree that the form and content of the SDK that NVIDIA  
provides may change without prior notice to you. While NVIDIA  
generally maintains compatibility between versions, NVIDIA may  
in some cases make changes that introduce incompatibilities in  
future versions of the SDK.  
  
  
  
  
1.1.6. Third Party Licenses  
  
  
The SDK may come bundled with, or otherwise include or be  
distributed with, third party software licensed by a NVIDIA  
supplier and/or open source software provided under an open  
source license. Use of third party software is subject to the  
third-party license terms, or in the absence of third party  
terms, the terms of this Agreement. Copyright to third party  
software is held by the copyright holders indicated in the  
third-party software or license.  
  
  
Subject to the other terms of this Agreement, you may use the  
SDK to develop and test applications released under Open  
Source Initiative (OSI) approved open source software  
licenses.  
  
  
  
  
1.1.7. Reservation of Rights  
  
  
NVIDIA reserves all rights, title, and interest in and to the  
SDK, not expressly granted to you under this Agreement.  
  
  
  
  
1.2. Limitations  
  
  
The following license limitations apply to your use of the  
SDK:  
  
  
1\. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble,  
or remove copyright or other proprietary notices from any  
portion of the SDK or copies of the SDK.  
  
  
2\. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, you may  
not copy, sell, rent, sublicense, transfer, distribute,  
modify, or create derivative works of any portion of the  
SDK. For clarity, you may not distribute or sublicense the  
SDK as a stand-alone product.  
  
  
3\. Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this  
purpose, you may not indicate that an application created  
with the SDK is sponsored or endorsed by NVIDIA.  
  
  
4\. You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any  
encryption, security, digital rights management or  
authentication mechanism in the SDK.  
  
  
5\. You may not use the SDK in any manner that would cause it  
to become subject to an open source software license. As  
examples, licenses that require as a condition of use,  
modification, and/or distribution that the SDK be:  
  
  
a. Disclosed or distributed in source code form;  
  
  
b. Licensed for the purpose of making derivative works;  
or  
  
  
c. Redistributable at no charge.  
  
  
6\. Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this  
purpose, you may not use the SDK with any system or  
application where the use or failure of the system or  
application can reasonably be expected to threaten or  
result in personal injury, death, or catastrophic loss.  
Examples include use in avionics, navigation, military,  
medical, life support or other life critical applications.  
NVIDIA does not design, test or manufacture the SDK for  
these critical uses and NVIDIA shall not be liable to you  
or any third party, in whole or in part, for any claims or  
damages arising from such uses.  
  
  
7\. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless NVIDIA  
and its affiliates, and their respective employees,  
contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and  
against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses,  
liabilities, costs or debt, fines, restitutions and  
expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees  
and costs incident to establishing the right of  
indemnification) arising out of or related to your use of  
the SDK outside of the scope of this Agreement, or not in  
compliance with its terms.  
  
  
  
  
1.3. Ownership  
  
  
1\. NVIDIA or its licensors hold all rights, title and  
interest in and to the SDK and its modifications and  
derivative works, including their respective intellectual  
property rights, subject to your rights under Section  
1.3.2. This SDK may include software and materials from  
NVIDIA’s licensors, and these licensors are intended  
third party beneficiaries that may enforce this Agreement  
with respect to their intellectual property rights.  
  
  
2\. You hold all rights, title and interest in and to your  
applications and your derivative works of the sample  
source code delivered in the SDK, including their  
respective intellectual property rights, subject to  
NVIDIA’s rights under Section 1.3.1.  
  
  
3\. You may, but don’t have to, provide to NVIDIA  
suggestions, feature requests or other feedback regarding  
the SDK, including possible enhancements or modifications  
to the SDK. For any feedback that you voluntarily provide,  
you hereby grant NVIDIA and its affiliates a perpetual,  
non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable license to use,  
reproduce, modify, license, sublicense (through multiple  
tiers of sublicensees), and distribute (through multiple  
tiers of distributors) it without the payment of any  
royalties or fees to you. NVIDIA will use feedback at its  
choice. NVIDIA is constantly looking for ways to improve  
its products, so you may send feedback to NVIDIA through  
the developer portal at https://developer.nvidia.com.  
  
  
  
  
1.4. No Warranties  
  
  
THE SDK IS PROVIDED BY NVIDIA "AS IS" AND "WITH ALL  
FAULTS." TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND  
ITS AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND  
OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING,  
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS  
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE  
ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT. NO  
WARRANTY IS MADE ON THE BASIS OF TRADE USAGE, COURSE OF  
DEALING OR COURSE OF TRADE.  
  
  
  
  
1.5. Limitation of Liability  
  
  
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS  
AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,  
PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS  
OF USE, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR THE COSTS OF  
PROCURING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION  
WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SDK,  
WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON BREACH  
OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),  
PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION OR THEORY OF  
LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL NVIDIA’S AND ITS AFFILIATES  
TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY UNDER OR ARISING OUT OF THIS  
AGREEMENT EXCEED US$10.00. THE NATURE OF THE LIABILITY OR THE  
NUMBER OF CLAIMS OR SUITS SHALL NOT ENLARGE OR EXTEND THIS  
LIMIT.  
  
  
These exclusions and limitations of liability shall apply  
regardless if NVIDIA or its affiliates have been advised of  
the possibility of such damages, and regardless of whether a  
remedy fails its essential purpose. These exclusions and  
limitations of liability form an essential basis of the  
bargain between the parties, and, absent any of these  
exclusions or limitations of liability, the provisions of this  
Agreement, including, without limitation, the economic terms,  
would be substantially different.  
  
  
  
  
1.6. Termination  
  
  
1\. This Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by  
either you or NVIDIA as described below.  
  
  
2\. If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by  
stopping to use the SDK.  
  
  
3\. NVIDIA may, at any time, terminate this Agreement if:  
  
  
a. (i) you fail to comply with any term of this  
Agreement and the non-compliance is not fixed within  
thirty (30) days following notice from NVIDIA (or  
immediately if you violate NVIDIA’s intellectual  
property rights);  
  
  
b. (ii) you commence or participate in any legal  
proceeding against NVIDIA with respect to the SDK; or  
  
  
c. (iii) NVIDIA decides to no longer provide the SDK in  
a country or, in NVIDIA’s sole discretion, the  
continued use of it is no longer commercially viable.  
  
  
4\. Upon any termination of this Agreement, you agree to  
promptly discontinue use of the SDK and destroy all copies  
in your possession or control. Your prior distributions in  
accordance with this Agreement are not affected by the  
termination of this Agreement. Upon written request, you  
will certify in writing that you have complied with your  
commitments under this section. Upon any termination of  
this Agreement all provisions survive except for the  
license grant provisions.  
  
  
  
  
1.7. General  
  
  
If you wish to assign this Agreement or your rights and  
obligations, including by merger, consolidation, dissolution  
or operation of law, contact NVIDIA to ask for permission. Any  
attempted assignment not approved by NVIDIA in writing shall  
be void and of no effect. NVIDIA may assign, delegate or  
transfer this Agreement and its rights and obligations, and if

or claim arising out of this Agreement. Notwithstanding this,  
you agree that NVIDIA shall still be allowed to apply for  
injunctive remedies or an equivalent type of urgent legal  
relief in any jurisdiction.  
  
  
If any court of competent jurisdiction determines that any  
provision of this Agreement is illegal, invalid or  
unenforceable, such provision will be construed as limited to  
the extent necessary to be consistent with and fully  
enforceable under the law and the remaining provisions will  
remain in full force and effect. Unless otherwise specified,  
remedies are cumulative.  
  
  
Each party acknowledges and agrees that the other is an  
independent contractor in the performance of this Agreement.

PCRE LICENCE  
\------------  
PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax  
and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.  
Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as  
specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc"  
directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The  
basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also  
included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a just-  
in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These are  
both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,  
non-exclusive license:  
  
  
(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)  
Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,  
modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its  
Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or

become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first  
distributes such Contribution.  
  
  
2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope  
  
  
The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under  
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the  
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.  
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a  
Contributor:  
  
  
(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;  
or  
  
  
(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's  
modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its  
Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor  
Version); or  
  
  
(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of  
its Contributions.  
  
  
This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,  
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with  
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).  
  
  
2.4. Subsequent Licenses  
  
  
No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to  
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this  
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if  
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).  
  
  
2.5. Representation  
  
  
Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its  
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights  
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.  
  
  
2.6. Fair Use  
  
  
This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under  
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other  
equivalents.  
  
  
2.7. Conditions  
  
  
Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted  
in Section 2.1.  
  
  
3\. Responsibilities  
\-------------------  
  
  
3.1. Distribution of Source Form  
  
  
All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any  
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under  
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source  
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this  
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not  
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code  
Form.  
  
  
3.2. Distribution of Executable Form  
  
  
If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:  
  
  
(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code  
Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of  
the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code  
Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more  
than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and  
  
  
(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this  
License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the  
license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter  
the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.  
  
  
3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work  
  
  
You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,  
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for  
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered  
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the  
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this  
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software  
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of  
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered  
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary  
License(s).  
  
  
3.4. Notices  
  
  
You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices  
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,  
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of  
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to  
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.  
  
  
3.5. Application of Additional Terms  
  
  
You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,  
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered  
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on  
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any  
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by  
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any  
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,  
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional  
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any  
jurisdiction.  
  
  
4\. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation  
\---------------------------------------------------  
  
  
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this  
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to  
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with  
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)  
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must  
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered  
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute  
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a  
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.  
  
  
5\. Termination  
\--------------  
  
  
5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically  
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become  
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular  
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such  
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an  
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the  
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have  
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular  
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor  
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the  
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License  
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after  
Your receipt of the notice.  
  
  
5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent  
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,  
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version  
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to  
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section  
2.1 of this License shall terminate.  
  
  
5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all  
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which  
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License  
prior to termination shall survive termination.

\* \*  
\* 6. Disclaimer of Warranty \*  
\* ------------------------- \*  
\* \*  
\* Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" \*  
\* basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or \*  
\* statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the \*  
\* Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a \*  
\* particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the \*  
\* quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. \*  
\* Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You \*  
\* (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, \*  
\* repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an \*  
\* essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is \*  
\* authorized under this License except under this disclaimer. \*

\* \*  
\* 7. Limitation of Liability \*  
\* -------------------------- \*  
\* \*  
\* Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort \*  
\* (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any \*  
\* Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as \*  
\* permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, \*  
\* special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character \*  
\* including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of \*  
\* goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any \*  
\* and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party \*  
\* shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This \*  
\* limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or \*  
\* personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the \*  
\* extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some \*  
\* jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of \*  
\* incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and \*  
\* limitation may not apply to You. \*  
\* \*  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
  
  
8\. Litigation  
\-------------  
  
  
Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the  
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal  
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that  
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.  
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring  
cross-claims or counter-claims.  
  
  
9\. Miscellaneous  
\----------------  
  
  
This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject  
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be  
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent  
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides  
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter  
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.  
  
  
10\. Versions of the License  
\---------------------------  
  
  
10.1. New Versions  
  
  
Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section  
10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or  
publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a  
distinguishing version number.  
  
  
10.2. Effect of New Versions  
  
  
You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version

GNU General Public License, version 3 (GPL-3.0)  
\[OSI Approved License\]  
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE  
  
  
Version 3, 29 June 2007  
  
  
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  
  
  
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  
Preamble  
  
  
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.  
  
  
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.  
  
  
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.  
  
  
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.  
  
  
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.  
  
  
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.  
  
  
For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.  
  
  
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.  
  
  
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.  
  
  
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.  
TERMS AND CONDITIONS  
0\. Definitions.  
  
  
�This License� refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.  
  
  
�Copyright� also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.  
  
  
�The Program� refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as �you�. �Licensees� and �recipients� may be individuals or organizations.  
  
  
To �modify� a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a �modified version� of the earlier work or a work �based on� the earlier work.  
  
  
A �covered work� means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.  
  
  
To �propagate� a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.  
  
  
To �convey� a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.  
  
  
An interactive user interface displays �Appropriate Legal Notices� to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.  
1\. Source Code.  
  
  
The �source code� for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. �Object code� means any non-source form of a work.  
  
  
A �Standard Interface� means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.  
  
  
The �System Libraries� of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A �Major Component�, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.  
  
  
The �Corresponding Source� for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.  
  
  
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.  
  
  
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.  
2\. Basic Permissions.  
  
  
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.  
  
  
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.  
  
  
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.  
3\. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.  
  
  
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.  
  
  
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.  
4\. Conveying Verbatim Copies.  
  
  
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.  
  
  
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.  
5\. Conveying Modified Source Versions.  
  
  
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  
  
  
a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.  
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to �keep intact all notices�.  
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.  
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.  
  
  
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an �aggregate� if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.  
6\. Conveying Non-Source Forms.  
  
  
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:  
  
  
a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.  
b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.  
c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.  
d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.  
e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.  
  
  
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.  
  
  
A �User Product� is either (1) a �consumer product�, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, �normally used� refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.  
  
  
�Installation Information� for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.  
  
  
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).  
  
  
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.  
  
  
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.  
7\. Additional Terms.  
  
  
�Additional permissions� are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.  
  
  
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.  
  
  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:  
  
  
a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or  
b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or  
c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or  
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or  
e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or  
f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.  
  
  
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered �further restrictions� within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.  
  
  
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.  
  
  
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.  
8\. Termination.  
  
  
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).  
  
  
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.  
  
  
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.  
  
  
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.  
9\. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.  
  
  
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.  
10\. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.  
  
  
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.  
  
  
An �entity transaction� is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.  
  
  
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.  
11\. Patents.  
  
  
A �contributor� is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's �contributor version�.  
  
  
A contributor's �essential patent claims� are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, �control� includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.  
  
  
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.  
  
  
In the following three paragraphs, a �patent license� is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To �grant� such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.  
  
  
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. �Knowingly relying� means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.  
  
  
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.  
  
  
A patent license is �discriminatory� if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.  
  
  
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.  
12\. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.  
  
  
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.  
13\. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.  
  
  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.  
14\. Revised Versions of this License.  
  
  
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  
  
  
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License �or any later version� applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.  
  
  
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.  
  
  
Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.  
15\. Disclaimer of Warranty.  
  
  
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM �AS IS� WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  
16\. Limitation of Liability.  
  
  
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  
17\. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.  
  
  
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.  
  
  
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS  
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs  
  
  
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.  
  
  
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the �copyright� line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.  
  
  
  
Copyright (C)  
  
  
This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify  
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by  
the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or  
(at your option) any later version.  
  
  
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,  
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of  
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the  
GNU General Public License for more details.  
  
  
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License  
along with this program. If not, see .  
  
  
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.  
  
  
If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:  
  
  
Copyright (C)  
  
  
This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type \`show w'.  
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it  
under certain conditions; type \`show c' for details.  
  
  
The hypothetical commands \`show w' and \`show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an �about box�.  
  
  
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a �copyright disclaimer� for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see .  
  
  
The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read .

Gettext version 0.18.1.1
------------------------

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE  
Version 3, 29 June 2007  
  
  
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  
  
  
Preamble  
  
  
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for  
software and other kinds of works.  
  
  
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed  
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,  
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to  
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free  
software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the  
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to  
any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to  
your programs, too.  
  
  
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not  
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you  
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for  
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you  
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new  
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.  
  
  
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you  
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have  
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if  
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.  
  
  
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether  
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same  
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive  
or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they  
know their rights.  
  
  
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:  
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License  
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.  
  
  
For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains  
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and  
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as  
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to  
authors of previous versions.  
  
  
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run  
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer  
can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of  
protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic  
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to  
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we  
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those  
products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we  
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions  
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.  
  
  
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.  
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of  
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to  
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could  
make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that  
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.  
  
  
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and  
modification follow.  
  
  
TERMS AND CONDITIONS  
  
  
0\. Definitions.  
  
  
"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.  
  
  
"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of  
works, such as semiconductor masks.  
  
  
"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this  
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and  
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.  
  
  
To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work  
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an  
exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the  
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.  
  
  
A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based  
on the Program.  
  
  
To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without  
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for  
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a  
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,  
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the  
public, and in some countries other activities as well.  
  
  
To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other  
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through  
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.  
  
  
An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"  
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible  
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)  
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the  
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the  
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If  
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a  
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.  
  
  
1\. Source Code.  
  
  
The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work  
for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source  
form of a work.  
  
  
A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official  
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of  
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that  
is widely used among developers working in that language.  
  
  
The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other  
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of  
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major  
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that  
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an  
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A  
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component  
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system  
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to  
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.  
  
  
The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all  
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable  
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to  
control those activities. However, it does not include the work's  
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free  
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but  
which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source  
includes interface definition files associated with source files for  
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically  
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,  
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those  
subprograms and other parts of the work.  
  
  
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users  
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding  
Source.  
  
  
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that  
same work.  
  
  
2\. Basic Permissions.  
  
  
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of  
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated  
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited  
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a  
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its  
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your  
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.  
  
  
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not  
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains  
in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose  
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you  
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with  
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do  
not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works  
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction  
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of  
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.  
  
  
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under  
the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10  
makes it unnecessary.  
  
  
3\. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.  
  
  
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological  
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article  
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or  
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such  
measures.  
  
  
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid  
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention  
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to  
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or  
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's  
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of  
technological measures.  
  
  
4\. Conveying Verbatim Copies.  
  
  
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you  
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and  
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;  
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any  
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;  
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all  
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.  
  
  
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,  
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.  
  
  
5\. Conveying Modified Source Versions.  
  
  
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to  
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the  
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  
  
  
a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified  
it, and giving a relevant date.  
  
  
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is  
released under this License and any conditions added under section  
7\. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to  
"keep intact all notices".  
  
  
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this  
License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This  
License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7  
additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,  
regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no  
permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not  
invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.  
  
  
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display  
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive  
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your  
work need not make them do so.  
  
  
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent  
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,  
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,  
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an  
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not  
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users  
beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work  
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other  
parts of the aggregate.  
  
  
6\. Conveying Non-Source Forms.  
  
  
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms  
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the  
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,  
in one of these ways:  
  
  
a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product  
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the  
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium  
customarily used for software interchange.  
  
  
b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product  
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a  
written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as  
long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product  
model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a  
copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the  
product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical  
medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no  
more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this  
conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the  
Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.  
  
  
c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the  
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This  
alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and  
only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord  
with subsection 6b.  
  
  
d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated  
place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the  
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no  
further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the  
Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to  
copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source  
may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)  
that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain  
clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the  
Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the  
Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is  
available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.  
  
  
e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided  
you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding  
Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no  
charge under subsection 6d.  
  
  
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded  
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be  
included in conveying the object code work.  
  
  
A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any  
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,  
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation  
into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,  
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular  
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a  
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status  
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user  
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product  
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial  
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent  
the only significant mode of use of the product.  
  
  
"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,  
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install  
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from  
a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must  
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object  
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because  
modification has been made.  
  
  
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or  
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as  
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the  
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a  
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the  
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied  
by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply  
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install  
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has  
been installed in ROM).  
  
  
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a  
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates  
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for  
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a  
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and  
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and  
protocols for communication across the network.  
  
  
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,  
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly  
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in  
source code form), and must require no special password or key for  
unpacking, reading or copying.  
  
  
7\. Additional Terms.  
  
  
"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this  
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.  
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall  
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent  
that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions  
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately  
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by  
this License without regard to the additional permissions.  
  
  
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option  
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of  
it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own  
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place  
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,  
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.  
  
  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you  
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of  
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:  
  
  
a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the  
terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or  
  
  
b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or  
author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal  
Notices displayed by works containing it; or  
  
  
c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or  
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in  
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or  
  
  
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or  
authors of the material; or  
  
  
e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some  
trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or  
  
  
f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that  
material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of  
it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for  
any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on  
those licensors and authors.  
  
  
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further  
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you  
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is  
governed by this License along with a term that is a further  
restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains  
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this  
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms  
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does  
not survive such relicensing or conveying.  
  
  
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you  
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the  
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating  
where to find the applicable terms.  
  
  
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the  
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;  
the above requirements apply either way.  
  
  
8\. Termination.  
  
  
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly  
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or  
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under  
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third  
paragraph of section 11).  
  
  
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your  
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)  
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and  
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright  
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means  
prior to 60 days after the cessation.  
  
  
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is  
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the  
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have  
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that  
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after  
your receipt of the notice.  
  
  
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the  
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under  
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently  
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same  
material under section 10.  
  
  
9\. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.  
  
  
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or  
run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work  
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission  
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,  
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or  
modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do  
not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a  
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.  
  
  
10\. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.  
  
  
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically  
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and  
propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible  
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.  
  
  
An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an  
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an  
organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered  
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that  
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever  
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could  
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the  
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if  
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.  
  
  
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the  
rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may  
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of  
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation  
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that  
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for  
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.  
  
  
11\. Patents.  
  
  
A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this  
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The  
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".  
  
  
A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims  
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or  
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted  
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,  
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a  
consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For  
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant  
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of  
this License.  
  
  
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free  
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to  
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and  
propagate the contents of its contributor version.  
  
  
In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express  
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent  
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to  
sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a  
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a  
patent against the party.  
  
  
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,  
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone  
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a  
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,  
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so  
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the  
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner  
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent  
license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have  
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the  
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work  
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that  
country that you have reason to believe are valid.  
  
  
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or  
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a  
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties  
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify  
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license  
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered  
work and works based on it.  
  
  
A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within  
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is  
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are  
specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered  
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is  
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment  
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying  
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the  
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory  
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work  
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily  
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that  
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,  
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.  
  
  
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting  
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may  
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.  
  
  
12\. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.  
  
  
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or  
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not  
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a  
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this  
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may  
not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you  
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey  
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this  
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.  
  
  
13\. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.  
  
  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have  
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed  
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single  
combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this  
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,  
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,  
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the  
combination as such.  
  
  
14\. Revised Versions of this License.  
  
  
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of  
the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will  
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to  
address new problems or concerns.  
  
  
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the  
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General  
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the  
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered  
version or of any later version published by the Free Software  
Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the  
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published  
by the Free Software Foundation.  
  
  
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future  
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's  
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you  
to choose that version for the Program.  
  
  
Later license versions may give you additional or different  
permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any  
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a  
later version.  
  
  
15\. Disclaimer of Warranty.  
  
  
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY  
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT  
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY  
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,  
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR  
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM  
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF  
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  
  
  
16\. Limitation of Liability.  
  
  
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING  
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS  
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY  
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE  
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF  
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD  
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),  
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF  
SUCH DAMAGES.  
  
  
17\. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.  
  
  
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided  
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,  
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates  
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the  
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a  
copy of the Program in return for a fee.  
  
  
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS  
  
  
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs  
  
  
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest  
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it  
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.  
  
  
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest  
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively  
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least  
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.  
  
  
  
Copyright (C)  
  
  
This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify  
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by  
the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or  
(at your option) any later version.  
  
  
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,  
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of  
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the  
GNU General Public License for more details.  
  
  
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License  
along with this program. If not, see .  
  
  
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.  
  
  
If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short  
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:  
  
  
Copyright (C)  
This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type \`show w'.  
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it  
under certain conditions; type \`show c' for details.  
  
  
The hypothetical commands \`show w' and \`show c' should show the appropriate  
parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands  
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".  
  
  
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,  
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see  
.  
  
  
The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program  
into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you  
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with  
the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General  
Public License instead of this License. But first, please read  
.

5\. Time Zone Database  
  
  
ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone  
Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database  
is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone  
Database section 7.  
  
  
\# 7. Database Ownership  
#  
\# The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF  
\# document. Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work  
\# that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the  
\# public domain. Therefore, BCPs 78 \[RFC5378\] and 79 \[RFC3979\] do  
\# not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make  
\# to it. Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ  
\# Database, the organization that is providing the IANA  
\# Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of  
\# understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance  
\# with all competent court orders. No ownership claims will be made  
\# by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code. Any person  
\# making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to  
\# future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.

Libiconv version 1.13.1
-----------------------

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE  
Version 3, 29 June 2007  
  
  
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  
  
  
Preamble  
  
  
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for  
software and other kinds of works.  
  
  
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed  
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,  
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to  
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free  
software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the  
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to  
any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to  
your programs, too.  
  
  
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not  
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you  
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for  
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you  
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new  
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.  
  
  
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you  
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have  
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if  
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.  
  
  
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether  
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same  
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive  
or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they  
know their rights.  
  
  
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:  
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License  
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.  
  
  
For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains  
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and  
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as  
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to  
authors of previous versions.  
  
  
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run  
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer  
can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of  
protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic  
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to  
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we  
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those  
products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we  
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions  
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.  
  
  
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.  
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of  
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to  
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could  
make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that  
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.  
  
  
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and  
modification follow.  
  
  
TERMS AND CONDITIONS  
  
  
0\. Definitions.  
  
  
"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.  
  
  
"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of  
works, such as semiconductor masks.  
  
  
"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this  
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and  
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.  
  
  
To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work  
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an  
exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the  
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.  
  
  
A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based  
on the Program.  
  
  
To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without  
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for  
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a  
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,  
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the  
public, and in some countries other activities as well.  
  
  
To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other  
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through  
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.  
  
  
An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"  
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible  
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)  
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the  
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the  
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If  
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a  
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.  
  
  
1\. Source Code.  
  
  
The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work  
for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source  
form of a work.  
  
  
A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official  
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of  
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that  
is widely used among developers working in that language.  
  
  
The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other  
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of  
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major  
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that  
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an  
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A  
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component  
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system  
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to  
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.  
  
  
The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all  
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable  
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to  
control those activities. However, it does not include the work's  
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free  
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but  
which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source  
includes interface definition files associated with source files for  
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically  
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,  
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those  
subprograms and other parts of the work.  
  
  
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users  
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding  
Source.  
  
  
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that  
same work.  
  
  
2\. Basic Permissions.  
  
  
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of  
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated  
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited  
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a  
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its  
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your  
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.  
  
  
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not  
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains  
in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose  
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you  
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with  
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do  
not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works  
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction  
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of  
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.  
  
  
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under  
the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10  
makes it unnecessary.  
  
  
3\. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.  
  
  
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological  
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article  
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or  
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such  
measures.  
  
  
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid  
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention  
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to  
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or  
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's  
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of  
technological measures.  
  
  
4\. Conveying Verbatim Copies.  
  
  
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you  
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and  
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;  
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any  
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;  
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all  
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.  
  
  
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,  
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.  
  
  
5\. Conveying Modified Source Versions.  
  
  
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to  
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the  
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  
  
  
a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified  
it, and giving a relevant date.  
  
  
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is  
released under this License and any conditions added under section  
7\. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to  
"keep intact all notices".  
  
  
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this  
License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This  
License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7  
additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,  
regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no  
permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not  
invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.  
  
  
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display  
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive  
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your  
work need not make them do so.  
  
  
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent  
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,  
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,  
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an  
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not  
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users  
beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work  
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other  
parts of the aggregate.  
  
  
6\. Conveying Non-Source Forms.  
  
  
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms  
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the  
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,  
in one of these ways:  
  
  
a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product  
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the  
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium  
customarily used for software interchange.  
  
  
b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product  
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a  
written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as  
long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product  
model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a  
copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the  
product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical  
medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no  
more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this  
conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the  
Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.  
  
  
c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the  
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This  
alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and  
only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord  
with subsection 6b.  
  
  
d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated  
place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the  
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no  
further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the  
Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to  
copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source  
may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)  
that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain  
clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the  
Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the  
Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is  
available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.  
  
  
e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided  
you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding  
Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no  
charge under subsection 6d.  
  
  
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded  
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be  
included in conveying the object code work.  
  
  
A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any  
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,  
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation  
into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,  
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular  
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a  
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status  
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user  
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product  
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial  
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent  
the only significant mode of use of the product.  
  
  
"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,  
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install  
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from  
a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must  
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object  
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because  
modification has been made.  
  
  
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or  
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as  
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the  
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a  
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the  
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied  
by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply  
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install  
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has  
been installed in ROM).  
  
  
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a  
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates  
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for  
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a  
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and  
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and  
protocols for communication across the network.  
  
  
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,  
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly  
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in  
source code form), and must require no special password or key for  
unpacking, reading or copying.  
  
  
7\. Additional Terms.  
  
  
"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this  
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.  
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall  
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent  
that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions  
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately  
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by  
this License without regard to the additional permissions.  
  
  
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option  
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of  
it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own  
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place  
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,  
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.  
  
  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you  
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of  
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:  
  
  
a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the  
terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or  
  
  
b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or  
author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal  
Notices displayed by works containing it; or  
  
  
c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or  
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in  
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or  
  
  
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or  
authors of the material; or  
  
  
e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some  
trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or  
  
  
f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that  
material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of  
it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for  
any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on  
those licensors and authors.  
  
  
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further  
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you  
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is  
governed by this License along with a term that is a further  
restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains  
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this  
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms  
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does  
not survive such relicensing or conveying.  
  
  
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you  
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the  
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating  
where to find the applicable terms.  
  
  
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the  
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;  
the above requirements apply either way.  
  
  
8\. Termination.  
  
  
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly  
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or  
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under  
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third  
paragraph of section 11).  
  
  
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your  
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)  
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and  
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright  
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means  
prior to 60 days after the cessation.  
  
  
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is  
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the  
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have  
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that  
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after  
your receipt of the notice.  
  
  
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the  
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under  
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently  
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same  
material under section 10.  
  
  
9\. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.  
  
  
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or  
run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work  
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission  
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,  
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or  
modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do  
not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a  
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.  
  
  
10\. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.  
  
  
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically  
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and  
propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible  
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.  
  
  
An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an  
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an  
organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered  
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that  
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever  
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could  
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the  
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if  
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.  
  
  
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the  
rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may  
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of  
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation  
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that  
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for  
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.  
  
  
11\. Patents.  
  
  
A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this  
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The  
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".  
  
  
A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims  
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or  
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted  
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,  
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a  
consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For  
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant  
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of  
this License.  
  
  
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free  
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to  
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and  
propagate the contents of its contributor version.  
  
  
In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express  
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent  
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to  
sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a  
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a  
patent against the party.  
  
  
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,  
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone  
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a  
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,  
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so  
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the  
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner  
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent  
license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have  
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the  
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work  
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that  
country that you have reason to believe are valid.  
  
  
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or  
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a  
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties  
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify  
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license  
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered  
work and works based on it.  
  
  
A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within  
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is  
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are  
specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered  
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is  
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment  
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying  
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the  
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory  
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work  
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily  
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that  
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,  
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.  
  
  
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting  
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may  
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.  
  
  
12\. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.  
  
  
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or  
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not  
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a  
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this  
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may  
not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you  
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey  
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this  
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.  
  
  
13\. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.  
  
  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have  
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed  
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single  
combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this  
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,  
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,  
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the  
combination as such.  
  
  
14\. Revised Versions of this License.  
  
  
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of  
the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will  
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to  
address new problems or concerns.  
  
  
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the  
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General  
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the  
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered  
version or of any later version published by the Free Software  
Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the  
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published  
by the Free Software Foundation.  
  
  
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future  
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's  
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you  
to choose that version for the Program.  
  
  
Later license versions may give you additional or different  
permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any  
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a  
later version.  
  
  
15\. Disclaimer of Warranty.  
  
  
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY  
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT  
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY  
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,  
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR  
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM  
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF  
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  
  
  
16\. Limitation of Liability.  
  
  
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING  
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS  
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY  
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE  
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF  
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD  
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),  
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF  
SUCH DAMAGES.  
  
  
17\. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.  
  
  
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided  
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,  
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates  
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the  
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a  
copy of the Program in return for a fee.  
  
  
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS  
  
  
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs  
  
  
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest  
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it  
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.  
  
  
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest  
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively  
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least  
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.  
  
  
  
Copyright (C)  
  
  
This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify  
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by  
the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or  
(at your option) any later version.  
  
  
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,  
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of  
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the  
GNU General Public License for more details.  
  
  
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License  
along with this program. If not, see .  
  
  
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.  
  
  
If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short  
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:  
  
  
Copyright (C)  
This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type \`show w'.  
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it  
under certain conditions; type \`show c' for details.  
  
  
The hypothetical commands \`show w' and \`show c' should show the appropriate  
parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands  
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".  
  
  
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,  
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see  
.  
  
  
The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program  
into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you  
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with  
the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General  
Public License instead of this License. But first, please read  
.

For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.  
  
  
"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."  
  
  
"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.  
  
  
2\. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.  
  
  
3\. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.  
  
  
4\. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:  
  
  
a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and  
  
  
b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.  
  
  
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.  
  
  
5\. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.  
  
  
6\. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.  
  
  
7\. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.  
  
  
8\. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  
9\. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

\---------------------------------------------------  
A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE  
\==========================  
Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting  
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands  
as a successor of a language called ABC. Guido remains Python's  
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.  
  
  
In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for  
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)  
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the  
software.  
  
  
In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to  
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team. In October of the same  
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope  
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com). In 2001, the Python Software  
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a  
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related  
Intellectual Property. Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of  
the PSF.  
  
  
All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for  
the Open Source Definition). Historically, most, but not all, Python  
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes  
the various releases.  
  
  
Release Derived Year Owner GPL-  
from compatible? (1)  
  
  
0.9.0 thru 1.2 1991-1995 CWI yes  
1.3 thru 1.5.2 1.2 1995-1999 CNRI yes  
1.6 1.5.2 2000 CNRI no  
2.0 1.6 2000 BeOpen.com no  
1.6.1 1.6 2001 CNRI yes (2)  
2.1 2.0+1.6.1 2001 PSF no  
2.0.1 2.0+1.6.1 2001 PSF yes  
2.1.1 2.1+2.0.1 2001 PSF yes  
2.1.2 2.1.1 2002 PSF yes  
2.1.3 2.1.2 2002 PSF yes  
2.2 and above 2.1.1 2001-now PSF yes  
  
  
Footnotes:  
  
  
(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under  
the GPL. All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute  
a modified version without making your changes open source. The  
GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with  
other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.  
  
  
(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,  
because its license has a choice of law clause. According to  
CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1  
is "not incompatible" with the GPL.  
  
  
Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's  
direction to make these releases possible.

MiniZip version 1.1
-------------------

MiniZip - Copyright (c) 1998-2010 - by Gilles Vollant - version 1.1 64 bits from Mathias Svensson  
  
  
Introduction  
\---------------------  
MiniZip 1.1 is built from MiniZip 1.0 by Gilles Vollant ( http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html )  
  
  
When adding ZIP64 support into minizip it would result into risk of breaking compatibility with minizip 1.0.  
All possible work was done for compatibility.  
  
  
  
  
Background  
\---------------------  
When adding ZIP64 support Mathias Svensson found that Even Rouault have added ZIP64  
support for unzip.c into minizip for a open source project called gdal ( http://www.gdal.org/ )  
  
  
That was used as a starting point. And after that ZIP64 support was added to zip.c  
some refactoring and code cleanup was also done.  
  
  
  
  
Changed from MiniZip 1.0 to MiniZip 1.1  
\---------------------------------------  
\* Added ZIP64 support for unzip ( by Even Rouault )  
\* Added ZIP64 support for zip ( by Mathias Svensson )  
\* Reverted some changed that Even Rouault did.  
\* Bunch of patches received from Gulles Vollant that he received for MiniZip from various users.  
\* Added unzip patch for BZIP Compression method (patch create by Daniel Borca)  
\* Added BZIP Compress method for zip  
\* Did some refactoring and code cleanup

Netgen version 6.2
------------------

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE  
Version 2.1, February 1999  
  
  
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA  
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  
  
  
\[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts  
as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence  
the version number 2.1.\]  
  
  
Preamble  
  
  
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your  
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public  
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change  
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  
  
  
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some  
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the  
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You  
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether  
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better  
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.  
  
  
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,  
not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that  
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge  
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get  
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of  
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do  
these things.  
  
  
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid  
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these  
rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for  
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.  
  
  
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis  
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave  
you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source  
code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide  
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them  
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling  
it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.  
  
  
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the  
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal  
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.  
  
  
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that  
there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is  
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know  
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original  
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be  
introduced by others.  
  
  
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of  
any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot  
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a  
restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that  
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be  
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.  
  
  
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the  
ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser  
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and  
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use  
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those  
libraries into non-free programs.  
  
  
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using  
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a  
combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary  
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the  
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General  
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with  
the library.  
  
  
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it  
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General  
Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less  
of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages  
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many  
libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain  
special circumstances.  
  
  
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to  
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes  
a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be  
allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free  
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this  
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free  
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.  
  
  
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free  
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of  
free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in  
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU  
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating  
system.  
  
  
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the  
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is  
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run  
that program using a modified version of the Library.  
  
  
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and  
modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a  
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The  
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must  
be combined with the library in order to run.  
  
  
GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE  
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION  
  
  
0\. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other  
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or  
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of  
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").  
Each licensee is addressed as "you".  
  
  
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data  
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs  
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.  
  
  
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work  
which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the  
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under  
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a  
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated  
straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is  
included without limitation in the term "modification".)  
  
  
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for  
making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means  
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated  
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation  
and installation of the library.  
  
  
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not  
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of  
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from  
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based  
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for  
writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does  
and what the program that uses the Library does.  
  
  
1\. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's  
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that  
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an  
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact  
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any  
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the  
Library.  
  
  
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,  
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a  
fee  
  
  
2\. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion  
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and  
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1  
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  
  
  
a) The modified work must itself be a software library.  
  
  
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices  
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.  
  
  
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no  
charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.  
  
  
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a  
table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses  
the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility  
is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,  
in the event an application does not supply such function or  
table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of  
its purpose remains meaningful.  
  
  
(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has  
a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the  
application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any  
application-supplied function or table used by this function must  
be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square  
root function must still compute square roots.)  
  
  
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If  
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,  
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in  
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those  
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you  
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based  
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of  
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the  
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote  
it.  
  
  
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest  
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to  
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or  
collective works based on the Library.  
  
  
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library  
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of  
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under  
the scope of this License.  
  
  
3\. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public  
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do  
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so  
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,  
instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the  
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify  
that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in  
these notices.  
  
  
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for  
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all  
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.  
  
  
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of  
the Library into a program that is not a library.  
  
  
4\. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or  
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form  
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany  
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which  
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a  
medium customarily used for software interchange.  
  
  
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy  
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the  
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to  
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not  
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.  
  
  
5\. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the  
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or  
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a  
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and  
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.  
  
  
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library  
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it  
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the  
library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.  
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.  
  
  
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file  
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a  
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.  
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be  
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The  
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.  
  
  
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data  
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline  
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object  
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative  
work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the  
Library will still fall under Section 6.)  
  
  
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may  
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.  
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,  
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.  
  
  
6\. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or  
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a  
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work  
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit  
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse  
engineering for debugging such modifications.  
  
  
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the  
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by  
this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work  
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the  
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference  
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one  
of these things:  
  
  
a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding  
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever  
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under  
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked  
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that  
uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the  
user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified  
executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood  
that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the  
Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application  
to use the modified definitions.)  
  
  
b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the  
Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a  
copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,  
rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)  
will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if  
the user installs one, as long as the modified version is  
interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.  
  
  
c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at  
least three years, to give the same user the materials  
specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more  
than the cost of performing this distribution.  
  
  
d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy  
from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above  
specified materials from the same place.  
  
  
e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these  
materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.  
  
  
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the  
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for  
reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,  
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is  
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major  
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on  
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies  
the executable.  
  
  
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license  
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally  
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot  
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you  
distribute.  
  
  
7\. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the  
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library  
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined  
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on  
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise  
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:  
  
  
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work  
based on the Library, uncombined with any other library  
facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the  
Sections above.  
  
  
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact  
that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining  
where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.  
  
  
8\. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute  
the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any  
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or  
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your  
rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,  
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses  
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.  
  
  
9\. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not  
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or  
distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are  
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by  
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the  
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and  
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying  
the Library or works based on it.  
  
  
10\. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the  
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the  
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library  
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further  
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.  
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with  
this License.  
  
  
11\. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent  
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),  
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or  
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not  
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot  
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this  
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you  
may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent  
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by  
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then  
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to  
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.  
  
  
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any  
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,  
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.  
  
  
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any  
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any  
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the  
integrity of the free software distribution system which is  
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made  
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed  
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that  
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing  
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot  
impose that choice.  
  
  
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to  
be a consequence of the rest of this License.  
  
  
12\. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in  
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the  
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add  
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,  
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus  
excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if  
written in the body of this License.  
  
  
13\. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new  
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.  
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,  
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  
  
  
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library  
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and  
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and  
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by  
the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a  
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by  
the Free Software Foundation.  
  
  
14\. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free  
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,  
write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is  
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free  
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our  
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status  
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing  
and reuse of software generally.  
  
  
NO WARRANTY  
  
  
15\. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO  
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR  
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY  
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE  
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR  
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE  
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME  
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  
  
  
16\. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN  
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY  
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU  
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR  
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE  
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING  
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A  
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF  
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH  
DAMAGES.  
  
  
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS  
  
  
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries  
  
  
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest  
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that  
everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting  
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the  
ordinary General Public License).  
  
  
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is  
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively  
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the  
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.  
  
  
  
Copyright (C)  
  
  
This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or  
modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public  
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either  
version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.  
  
  
This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,  
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of  
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU  
Lesser General Public License for more details.  
  
  
You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public  
License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software  
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA  
  
  
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.  
  
  
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your  
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if  
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:  
  
  
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the  
library \`Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.  
  
  
, 1 April 1990  
Ty Coon, President of Vice  
  
  
That's all there is to it!

NLopt version 2.6.2
-------------------

NLopt License and Copyright  
The NLopt library is under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), and the copyrights are owned by a variety of authors.  
  
  
In general, the different code in NLopt comes from different sources, and have a variety of licenses. For example, all of the new code we wrote for NLopt is under the MIT License (which imposes essentially no practical restrictions, and is hence compatible with the LGPL). The combination of all of this software is under the conjunction of the license terms, and in particular they are limited by the most restrictive of the licenses for the portions, which in this case is the LGPL. (The other portions of NLopt are under LGPL-compatible, less-restrictive licenses like the MIT license. So, if you remove the LGPL portions, which are currently code by Ladislav Luksan, the remainder reverts to a looser license.)  
  
  
New code written for NLopt, including tutorial code at NLopt Tutorial, is Copyright © 2007-2020 Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other authors, and comes with no warranty:  
  
  
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or  
Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object  
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable  
copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,  
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the  
Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.  
  
  
3\. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,  
use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,  
where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable  
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their  
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)  
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You  
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a  
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses  
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate  
as of the date such litigation is filed.

meet the following conditions:  
  
  
(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or

(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works  
that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and  
attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,  
excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of  
the Derivative Works; and  
  
  
(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its  
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must  
include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained  
within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not  
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one  
of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed  
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or  
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,  
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and  
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents  
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and  
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution  
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside  
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided  
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed  
as modifying the License.  
  
  
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and  
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions  
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or  
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,  
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with  
the conditions stated in this License.  
  
  
5\. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,  
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work  
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of  
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.  
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify  
the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed  
with Licensor regarding such Contributions.  
  
  
6\. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.  
  
  
7\. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or  
agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each  
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,  
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or  
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions  
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A  
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the  
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any  
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.  
  
  
8\. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,  
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,  
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly  
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be  
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,  
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a  
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the  
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,  
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all  
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor  
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  
  
  
9\. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing  
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,  
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,  
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this  
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only  
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf  
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,  
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability  
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason  
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

junitxml, version 0.7 - LGPL-3 license  
  
  
GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE  
Version 3, 29 June 2007  
  
  
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  
  
  
  
  
This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates  
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public  
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.  
  
  
0\. Additional Definitions.  
  
  
As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser  
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU  
General Public License.  
  
  
"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,  
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.  
  
  
An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided  
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.  
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode  
of using an interface provided by the Library.  
  
  
A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an  
Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library  
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked  
Version".  
  
  
The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the  
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code  
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are  
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.  
  
  
The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the  
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data  
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the  
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.  
  
  
1\. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.  
  
  
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License  
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.  
  
  
2\. Conveying Modified Versions.  
  
  
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a  
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application  
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the  
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified  
version:  
  
  
a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to  
ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the  
function or data, the facility still operates, and performs  
whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or  
  
  
b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of  
this License applicable to that copy.  
  
  
3\. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.  
  
  
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from  
a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object  
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated  
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure  
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates  
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:  
  
  
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the  
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are  
covered by this License.  
  
  
b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license  
document.  
  
  
4\. Combined Works.  
  
  
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,  
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the  
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse  
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of  
the following:  
  
  
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that  
the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are  
covered by this License.  
  
  
b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license  
document.  
  
  
c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during  
execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among  
these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the  
copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.  
  
  
d) Do one of the following:  
  
  
0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this  
License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form  
suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to  
recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of  
the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the  
manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying  
Corresponding Source.  
  
  
1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the  
Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time  
a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer  
system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version  
of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked  
Version.  
  
  
e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise  
be required to provide such information under section 6 of the  
GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is  
necessary to install and execute a modified version of the  
Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the  
Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If  
you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany  
the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application  
Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation  
Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL  
for conveying Corresponding Source.)  
  
  
5\. Combined Libraries.  
  
  
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the  
Library side by side in a single library together with other library  
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this  
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your  
choice, if you do both of the following:  
  
  
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based  
on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,  
conveyed under the terms of this License.  
  
  
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it  
is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the  
accompanying uncombined form of the same work.  
  
  
6\. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.  
  
  
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions  
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new  
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may  
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  
  
  
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the  
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version  
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"  
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and  
conditions either of that published version or of any later version  
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you  
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser  
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser  
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.  
  
  
If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide  
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall  
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is  
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the  
Library.

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION  
  
  
Version 3.1, 31 March 2009  
  
  
Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  
  
  
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this  
license document, but changing it is not allowed.  
  
  
This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional  
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version  
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that  
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that  
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.  
  
  
When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of  
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled  
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of  
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the  
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.  
  
  
0\. Definitions.  
  
  
A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime  
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an  
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based  
on the Runtime Library.  
  
  
"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without  
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of  
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any  
subsequent versions published by the FSF.  
  
  
"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,  
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with  
the license of GCC.  
  
  
"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual  
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for  
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution  
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any  
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used  
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.  
  
  
The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in  
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in  
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,  
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered  
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be  
understood as starting with the output of the generators or  
preprocessors.  
  
  
A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or  
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any  
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to  
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an  
Eligible Compilation Process.  
  
  
1\. Grant of Additional Permission.  
  
  
You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by  
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such  
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that  
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You  
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,  
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.  
  
  
2\. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.  
  
  
The availability of this Exception does not imply any general  
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft  
requirements of the license of GCC.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE  
Version 3, 29 June 2007  
  
  
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  
  
  
Preamble  
  
  
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for  
software and other kinds of works.  
  
  
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed  
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,  
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to  
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free  
software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the  
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to  
any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to  
your programs, too.  
  
  
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not  
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you  
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for  
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you  
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new  
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.  
  
  
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you  
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have  
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if  
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.  
  
  
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether  
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same  
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive  
or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they  
know their rights.  
  
  
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:  
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License  
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.  
  
  
For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains  
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and  
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as  
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to  
authors of previous versions.  
  
  
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run  
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer  
can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of  
protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic  
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to  
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we  
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those  
products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we  
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions  
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.  
  
  
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.  
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of  
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to  
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could  
make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that  
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.  
  
  
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and  
modification follow.  
  
  
TERMS AND CONDITIONS  
  
  
0\. Definitions.  
  
  
"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.  
  
  
"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of  
works, such as semiconductor masks.  
  
  
"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this  
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and  
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.  
  
  
To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work  
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an  
exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the  
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.  
  
  
A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based  
on the Program.  
  
  
To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without  
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for  
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a  
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,  
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the  
public, and in some countries other activities as well.  
  
  
To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other  
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through  
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.  
  
  
An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"  
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible  
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)  
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the  
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the  
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If  
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a  
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.  
  
  
1\. Source Code.  
  
  
The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work  
for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source  
form of a work.  
  
  
A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official  
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of  
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that  
is widely used among developers working in that language.  
  
  
The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other  
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of  
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major  
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that  
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an  
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A  
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component  
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system  
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to  
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.  
  
  
The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all  
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable  
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to  
control those activities. However, it does not include the work's  
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free  
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but  
which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source  
includes interface definition files associated with source files for  
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically  
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,  
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those  
subprograms and other parts of the work.  
  
  
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users  
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding  
Source.  
  
  
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that  
same work.  
  
  
2\. Basic Permissions.  
  
  
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of  
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated  
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited  
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a  
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its  
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your  
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.  
  
  
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not  
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains  
in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose  
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you  
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with  
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do  
not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works  
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction  
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of  
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.  
  
  
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under  
the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10  
makes it unnecessary.  
  
  
3\. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.  
  
  
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological  
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article  
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or  
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such  
measures.  
  
  
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid  
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention  
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to  
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or  
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's  
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of  
technological measures.  
  
  
4\. Conveying Verbatim Copies.  
  
  
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you  
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and  
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;  
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any  
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;  
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all  
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.  
  
  
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,  
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.  
  
  
5\. Conveying Modified Source Versions.  
  
  
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to  
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the  
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  
  
  
a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified  
it, and giving a relevant date.  
  
  
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is  
released under this License and any conditions added under section  
7\. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to  
"keep intact all notices".  
  
  
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this  
License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This  
License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7  
additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,  
regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no  
permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not  
invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.  
  
  
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display  
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive  
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your  
work need not make them do so.  
  
  
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent  
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,  
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,  
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an  
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not  
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users  
beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work  
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other  
parts of the aggregate.  
  
  
6\. Conveying Non-Source Forms.  
  
  
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms  
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the  
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,  
in one of these ways:  
  
  
a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product  
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the  
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium  
customarily used for software interchange.  
  
  
b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product  
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a  
written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as  
long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product  
model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a  
copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the  
product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical  
medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no  
more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this  
conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the  
Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.  
  
  
c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the  
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This  
alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and  
only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord  
with subsection 6b.  
  
  
d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated  
place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the  
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no  
further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the  
Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to  
copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source  
may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)  
that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain  
clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the  
Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the  
Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is  
available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.  
  
  
e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided  
you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding  
Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no  
charge under subsection 6d.  
  
  
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded  
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be  
included in conveying the object code work.  
  
  
A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any  
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,  
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation  
into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,  
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular  
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a  
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status  
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user  
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product  
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial  
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent  
the only significant mode of use of the product.  
  
  
"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,  
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install  
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from  
a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must  
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object  
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because  
modification has been made.  
  
  
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or  
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as  
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the  
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a  
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the  
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied  
by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply  
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install  
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has  
been installed in ROM).  
  
  
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a  
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates  
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for  
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a  
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and  
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and  
protocols for communication across the network.  
  
  
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,  
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly  
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in  
source code form), and must require no special password or key for  
unpacking, reading or copying.  
  
  
7\. Additional Terms.  
  
  
"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this  
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.  
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall  
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent  
that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions  
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately  
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by  
this License without regard to the additional permissions.  
  
  
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option  
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of  
it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own  
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place  
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,  
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.  
  
  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you  
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of  
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:  
  
  
a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the  
terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or  
  
  
b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or  
author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal  
Notices displayed by works containing it; or  
  
  
c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or  
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in  
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or  
  
  
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or  
authors of the material; or  
  
  
e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some  
trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or  
  
  
f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that  
material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of  
it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for  
any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on  
those licensors and authors.  
  
  
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further  
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you  
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is  
governed by this License along with a term that is a further  
restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains  
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this  
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms  
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does  
not survive such relicensing or conveying.  
  
  
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you  
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the  
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating  
where to find the applicable terms.  
  
  
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the  
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;  
the above requirements apply either way.  
  
  
8\. Termination.  
  
  
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly  
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or  
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under  
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third  
paragraph of section 11).  
  
  
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your  
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)  
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and  
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright  
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means  
prior to 60 days after the cessation.  
  
  
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is  
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the  
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have  
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that  
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after  
your receipt of the notice.  
  
  
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the  
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under  
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently  
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same  
material under section 10.  
  
  
9\. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.  
  
  
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or  
run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work  
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission  
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,  
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or  
modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do  
not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a  
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.  
  
  
10\. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.  
  
  
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically  
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and  
propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible  
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.  
  
  
An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an  
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an  
organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered  
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that  
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever  
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could  
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the  
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if  
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.  
  
  
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the  
rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may  
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of  
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation  
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that  
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for  
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.  
  
  
11\. Patents.  
  
  
A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this  
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The  
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".  
  
  
A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims  
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or  
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted  
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,  
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a  
consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For  
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant  
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of  
this License.  
  
  
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free  
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to  
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and  
propagate the contents of its contributor version.  
  
  
In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express  
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent  
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to  
sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a  
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a  
patent against the party.  
  
  
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,  
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone  
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a  
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,  
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so  
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the  
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner  
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent  
license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have  
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the  
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work  
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that  
country that you have reason to believe are valid.  
  
  
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or  
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a  
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties  
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify  
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license  
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered  
work and works based on it.  
  
  
A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within  
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is  
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are  
specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered  
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is  
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment  
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying  
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the  
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory  
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work  
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily  
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that  
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,  
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.  
  
  
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting  
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may  
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.  
  
  
12\. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.  
  
  
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or  
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not  
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a  
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this  
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may  
not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you  
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey  
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this  
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.  
  
  
13\. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.  
  
  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have  
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed  
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single  
combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this  
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,  
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,  
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the  
combination as such.  
  
  
14\. Revised Versions of this License.  
  
  
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of  
the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will  
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to  
address new problems or concerns.  
  
  
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the  
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General  
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the  
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered  
version or of any later version published by the Free Software  
Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the  
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published  
by the Free Software Foundation.  
  
  
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future  
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's  
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you  
to choose that version for the Program.  
  
  
Later license versions may give you additional or different  
permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any  
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a  
later version.  
  
  
15\. Disclaimer of Warranty.  
  
  
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY  
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT  
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY  
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,  
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR  
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM  
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF  
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  
  
  
16\. Limitation of Liability.  
  
  
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING  
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS  
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY  
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE  
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF  
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD  
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),  
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF  
SUCH DAMAGES.  
  
  
17\. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.  
  
  
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided  
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,  
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates  
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the  
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a  
copy of the Program in return for a fee.  
  
  
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS  
  
  
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs  
  
  
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest  
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it  
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.  
  
  
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest  
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively  
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least  
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.  
  
  
  
Copyright (C)  
  
  
This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify  
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by  
the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or  
(at your option) any later version.  
  
  
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,  
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of  
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the  
GNU General Public License for more details.  
  
  
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License  
along with this program. If not, see .  
  
  
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.  
  
  
If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short  
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:  
  
  
Copyright (C)  
This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type \`show w'.  
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it  
under certain conditions; type \`show c' for details.  
  
  
The hypothetical commands \`show w' and \`show c' should show the appropriate  
parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands  
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".  
  
  
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,  
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see  
.  
  
  
The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program  
into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you  
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with  
the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General  
Public License instead of this License. But first, please read  
.

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION  
  
  
Version 3.1, 31 March 2009  
  
  
Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  
  
  
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this  
license document, but changing it is not allowed.  
  
  
This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional  
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version  
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that  
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that  
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.  
  
  
When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of  
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled  
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of  
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the  
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.  
  
  
0\. Definitions.  
  
  
A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime  
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an  
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based  
on the Runtime Library.  
  
  
"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without  
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of  
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any  
subsequent versions published by the FSF.  
  
  
"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,  
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with  
the license of GCC.  
  
  
"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual  
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for  
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution  
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any  
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used  
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.  
  
  
The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in  
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in  
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,  
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered  
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be  
understood as starting with the output of the generators or  
preprocessors.  
  
  
A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or  
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any  
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to  
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an  
Eligible Compilation Process.  
  
  
1\. Grant of Additional Permission.  
  
  
You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by  
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such  
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that  
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You  
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,  
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.  
  
  
2\. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.  
  
  
The availability of this Exception does not imply any general  
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft  
requirements of the license of GCC.  
  
  
\----  
  
  
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE  
Version 3, 29 June 2007  
  
  
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.  
  
  
Preamble  
  
  
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for  
software and other kinds of works.  
  
  
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed  
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,  
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to  
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free  
software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the  
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to  
any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to  
your programs, too.  
  
  
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not  
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you  
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for  
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you  
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new  
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.  
  
  
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you  
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have  
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if  
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.  
  
  
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether  
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same  
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive  
or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they  
know their rights.  
  
  
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:  
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License  
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.  
  
  
For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains  
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and  
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as  
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to  
authors of previous versions.  
  
  
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run  
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer  
can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of  
protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic  
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to  
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we  
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those  
products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we  
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions  
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.  
  
  
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.  
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of  
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to  
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could  
make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that  
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.  
  
  
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and  
modification follow.  
  
  
TERMS AND CONDITIONS  
  
  
0\. Definitions.  
  
  
"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.  
  
  
"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of  
works, such as semiconductor masks.  
  
  
"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this  
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and  
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.  
  
  
To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work  
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an  
exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the  
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.  
  
  
A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based  
on the Program.  
  
  
To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without  
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for  
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a  
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,  
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the  
public, and in some countries other activities as well.  
  
  
To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other  
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through  
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.  
  
  
An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"  
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible  
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)  
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the  
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the  
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If  
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a  
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.  
  
  
1\. Source Code.  
  
  
The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work  
for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source  
form of a work.  
  
  
A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official  
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of  
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that  
is widely used among developers working in that language.  
  
  
The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other  
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of  
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major  
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that  
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an  
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A  
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component  
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system  
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to  
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.  
  
  
The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all  
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable  
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to  
control those activities. However, it does not include the work's  
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free  
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but  
which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source  
includes interface definition files associated with source files for  
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically  
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,  
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those  
subprograms and other parts of the work.  
  
  
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users  
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding  
Source.  
  
  
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that  
same work.  
  
  
2\. Basic Permissions.  
  
  
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of  
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated  
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited  
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a  
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its  
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your  
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.  
  
  
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not  
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains  
in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose  
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you  
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with  
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do  
not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works  
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction  
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of  
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.  
  
  
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under  
the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10  
makes it unnecessary.  
  
  
3\. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.  
  
  
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological  
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article  
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or  
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such  
measures.  
  
  
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid  
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention  
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to  
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or  
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's  
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of  
technological measures.  
  
  
4\. Conveying Verbatim Copies.  
  
  
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you  
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and  
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;  
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any  
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;  
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all  
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.  
  
  
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,  
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.  
  
  
5\. Conveying Modified Source Versions.  
  
  
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to  
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the  
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  
  
  
a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified  
it, and giving a relevant date.  
  
  
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is  
released under this License and any conditions added under section  
7\. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to  
"keep intact all notices".  
  
  
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this  
License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This  
License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7  
additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,  
regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no  
permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not  
invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.  
  
  
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display  
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive  
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your  
work need not make them do so.  
  
  
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent  
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,  
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,  
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an  
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not  
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users  
beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work  
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other  
parts of the aggregate.  
  
  
6\. Conveying Non-Source Forms.  
  
  
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms  
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the  
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,  
in one of these ways:  
  
  
a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product  
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the  
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium  
customarily used for software interchange.  
  
  
b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product  
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a  
written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as  
long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product  
model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a  
copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the  
product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical  
medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no  
more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this  
conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the  
Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.  
  
  
c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the  
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This  
alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and  
only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord  
with subsection 6b.  
  
  
d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated  
place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the  
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no  
further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the  
Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to  
copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source  
may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)  
that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain  
clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the  
Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the  
Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is  
available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.  
  
  
e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided  
you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding  
Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no  
charge under subsection 6d.  
  
  
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded  
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be  
included in conveying the object code work.  
  
  
A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any  
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,  
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation  
into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,  
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular  
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a  
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status  
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user  
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product  
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial  
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent  
the only significant mode of use of the product.  
  
  
"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,  
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install  
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from  
a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must  
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object  
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because  
modification has been made.  
  
  
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or  
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as  
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the  
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a  
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the  
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied  
by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply  
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install  
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has  
been installed in ROM).  
  
  
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a  
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates  
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for  
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a  
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and  
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and  
protocols for communication across the network.  
  
  
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,  
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly  
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in  
source code form), and must require no special password or key for  
unpacking, reading or copying.  
  
  
7\. Additional Terms.  
  
  
"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this  
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.  
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall  
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent  
that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions  
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately  
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by  
this License without regard to the additional permissions.  
  
  
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option  
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of  
it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own  
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place  
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,  
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.  
  
  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you  
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of  
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:  
  
  
a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the  
terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or  
  
  
b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or  
author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal  
Notices displayed by works containing it; or  
  
  
c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or  
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in  
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or  
  
  
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or  
authors of the material; or  
  
  
e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some  
trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or  
  
  
f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that  
material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of  
it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for  
any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on  
those licensors and authors.  
  
  
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further  
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you  
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is  
governed by this License along with a term that is a further  
restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains  
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this  
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms  
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does  
not survive such relicensing or conveying.  
  
  
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you  
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the  
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating  
where to find the applicable terms.  
  
  
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the  
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;  
the above requirements apply either way.  
  
  
8\. Termination.  
  
  
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly  
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or  
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under  
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third  
paragraph of section 11).  
  
  
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your  
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)  
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and  
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright  
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means  
prior to 60 days after the cessation.  
  
  
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is  
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the  
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have  
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that  
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after  
your receipt of the notice.  
  
  
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the  
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under  
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently  
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same  
material under section 10.  
  
  
9\. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.  
  
  
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or  
run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work  
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission  
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,  
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or  
modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do  
not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a  
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.  
  
  
10\. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.  
  
  
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically  
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and  
propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible  
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.  
  
  
An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an  
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an  
organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered  
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that  
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever  
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could  
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the  
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if  
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.  
  
  
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the  
rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may  
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of  
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation  
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that  
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for  
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.  
  
  
11\. Patents.  
  
  
A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this  
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The  
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".  
  
  
A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims  
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or  
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted  
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,  
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a  
consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For  
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant  
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of  
this License.  
  
  
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free  
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to  
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and  
propagate the contents of its contributor version.  
  
  
In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express  
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent  
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to  
sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a  
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a  
patent against the party.  
  
  
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,  
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone  
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a  
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,  
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so  
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the  
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner  
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent  
license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have  
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the  
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work  
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that  
country that you have reason to believe are valid.  
  
  
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or  
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a  
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties  
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify  
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license  
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered  
work and works based on it.  
  
  
A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within  
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is  
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are  
specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered  
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is  
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment  
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying  
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the  
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory  
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work  
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily  
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that  
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,  
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.  
  
  
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting  
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may  
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.  
  
  
12\. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.  
  
  
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or  
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not  
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a  
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this  
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may  
not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you  
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey  
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this  
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.  
  
  
13\. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.  
  
  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have  
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed  
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single  
combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this  
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,  
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,  
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the  
combination as such.  
  
  
14\. Revised Versions of this License.  
  
  
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of  
the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will  
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to  
address new problems or concerns.  
  
  
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the  
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General  
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the  
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered  
version or of any later version published by the Free Software  
Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the  
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published  
by the Free Software Foundation.  
  
  
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future  
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's  
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you  
to choose that version for the Program.  
  
  
Later license versions may give you additional or different  
permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any  
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a  
later version.  
  
  
15\. Disclaimer of Warranty.  
  
  
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY  
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT  
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY  
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,  
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR  
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM  
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF  
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  
  
  
16\. Limitation of Liability.  
  
  
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING  
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS  
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY  
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE  
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF  
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD  
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),  
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF  
SUCH DAMAGES.  
  
  
17\. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.  
  
  
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided  
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,  
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates  
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the  
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a  
copy of the Program in return for a fee.  
  
  
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS  
  
  
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs  
  
  
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest  
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it  
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.  
  
  
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest  
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively  
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least  
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.  
  
  
  
Copyright (C)  
  
  
This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify  
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by  
the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or  
(at your option) any later version.  
  
  
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,  
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of  
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the  
GNU General Public License for more details.  
  
  
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License  
along with this program. If not, see .  
  
  
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.  
  
  
If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short  
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:  
  
  
Copyright (C)  
This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type \`show w'.  
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it  
under certain conditions; type \`show c' for details.  
  
  
The hypothetical commands \`show w' and \`show c' should show the appropriate  
parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands  
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".  
  
  
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,  
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see  
.  
  
  
The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program  
into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you  
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with  
the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General  
Public License instead of this License. But first, please read  
.

where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable  
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their  
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)  
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You  
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a  
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work  
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct  
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses  
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate  
as of the date such litigation is filed.  
.  
4\. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the  
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without  
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You  
meet the following conditions:

excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of  
the Derivative Works; and  
.  
(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its  
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must  
include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained  
within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not  
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one  
of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed  
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or  
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,  
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and  
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents  
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and  
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution  
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside  
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided  
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed  
as modifying the License.  
.  
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and  
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions  
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or  
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each  
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,  
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or  
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions  
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A  
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the  
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any  
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.  
.  
8\. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,  
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,  
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly  
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be  
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,  
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a  
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the  
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,

Python version 3.8.10
---------------------

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE  
\==========================  
  
  
Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting  
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands  
as a successor of a language called ABC. Guido remains Python's  
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.  
  
  
In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for  
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)  
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the  
software.  
  
  
In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to  
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team. In October of the same  
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became  
Zope Corporation. In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see  
https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization  
created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.  
Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.  
  
  
All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for  
the Open Source Definition). Historically, most, but not all, Python  
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes  
the various releases.  
  
  
Release Derived Year Owner GPL-  
from compatible? (1)  
  
  
0.9.0 thru 1.2 1991-1995 CWI yes  
1.3 thru 1.5.2 1.2 1995-1999 CNRI yes  
1.6 1.5.2 2000 CNRI no  
2.0 1.6 2000 BeOpen.com no  
1.6.1 1.6 2001 CNRI yes (2)  
2.1 2.0+1.6.1 2001 PSF no  
2.0.1 2.0+1.6.1 2001 PSF yes  
2.1.1 2.1+2.0.1 2001 PSF yes  
2.1.2 2.1.1 2002 PSF yes  
2.1.3 2.1.2 2002 PSF yes  
2.2 and above 2.1.1 2001-now PSF yes  
  
  
Footnotes:  
  
  
(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under  
the GPL. All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute  
a modified version without making your changes open source. The  
GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with  
other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.  
  
  
(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,  
because its license has a choice of law clause. According to  
CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1  
is "not incompatible" with the GPL.  
  
  
Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's  
direction to make these releases possible.  
  
  
  
  
B. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR ACCESSING OR OTHERWISE USING PYTHON

INFRINGE ANY THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.  
  
  
5\. CNRI SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER USERS OF PYTHON  
1.6.1 FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSS AS  
A RESULT OF MODIFYING, DISTRIBUTING, OR OTHERWISE USING PYTHON 1.6.1,  
OR ANY DERIVATIVE THEREOF, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.  
  
  
6\. This License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a material  
breach of its terms and conditions.  
  
  
7\. This License Agreement shall be governed by the federal  
intellectual property law of the United States, including without  
limitation the federal copyright law, and, to the extent such  
U.S. federal law does not apply, by the law of the Commonwealth of  
Virginia, excluding Virginia's conflict of law provisions.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with regard to derivative works based  
on Python 1.6.1 that incorporate non-separable material that was  
previously distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), the  
law of the Commonwealth of Virginia shall govern this License  
Agreement only as to issues arising under or with respect to  
Paragraphs 4, 5, and 7 of this License Agreement. Nothing in this  
License Agreement shall be deemed to create any relationship of  
agency, partnership, or joint venture between CNRI and Licensee. This  
License Agreement does not grant permission to use CNRI trademarks or  
trade name in a trademark sense to endorse or promote products or  
services of Licensee, or any third party.

the code through a linker.  
  
  
If you further distribute programs that include the Microsoft  
Distributable Code, you must comply with the restrictions on  
distribution specified by Microsoft. In particular, you must require  
distributors and external end users to agree to terms that protect the  
Microsoft Distributable Code at least as much as Microsoft's own  
requirements for the Distributable Code. See Microsoft's documentation

than Microsoft operating systems, run-time technologies or application  
platforms; or  
  
  
\- include Microsoft Distributable Code in malicious, deceptive or  
unlawful programs.  
  
  
These restrictions apply only to the Microsoft Distributable Code as  
defined above, not to Python itself or any programs running on the  
Python interpreter. The redistribution of the Python interpreter and  
libraries is governed by the Python Software License included with this

SQLite version 3.16.2
---------------------

Copyright Release for  
Contributions To SQLite  
  
  
SQLite is software that implements an embeddable SQL database engine. SQLite is available for free download from http://www.sqlite.org/. The principal author and maintainer of SQLite has disclaimed all copyright interest in his contributions to SQLite and thus released his contributions into the public domain. In order to keep the SQLite software unencumbered by copyright claims, the principal author asks others who may from time to time contribute changes and enhancements to likewise disclaim their own individual copyright interest.  
  
  
Because the SQLite software found at http://www.sqlite.org/ is in the public domain, anyone is free to download the SQLite software from that website, make changes to the software, use, distribute, or sell the modified software, under either the original name or under some new name, without any need to obtain permission, pay royalties, acknowledge the original source of the software, or in any other way compensate, identify, or notify the original authors. Nobody is in any way compelled to contribute their SQLite changes and enhancements back to the SQLite website. This document concerns only changes and enhancements to SQLite that are intentionally and deliberately contributed back to the SQLite website.  
  
  
For the purposes of this document, "SQLite software" shall mean any computer source code, documentation, makefiles, test scripts, or other information that is published on the SQLite website, http://www.sqlite.org/. Precompiled binaries are excluded from the definition of "SQLite software" in this document because the process of compiling the software may introduce information from outside sources which is not properly a part of SQLite.  
  
  
The header comments on the SQLite source files exhort the reader to share freely and to never take more than one gives. In the spirit of that exhortation I make the following declarations:  
  
  
I dedicate to the public domain any and all copyright interest in the SQLite software that was publicly available on the SQLite website (http://www.sqlite.org/) prior to the date of the signature below and any changes or enhancements to the SQLite software that I may cause to be published on that website in the future. I make this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and to the detriment of my heirs and successors. I intend this dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all present and future rights to the SQLite software under copyright law.  
  
  
To the best of my knowledge and belief, the changes and enhancements that I have contributed to SQLite are either originally written by me or are derived from prior works which I have verified are also in the public domain and are not subject to claims of copyright by other parties.  
  
  
To the best of my knowledge and belief, no individual, business, organization, government, or other entity has any copyright interest in the SQLite software as it existed on the SQLite website as of the date on the signature line below.  
  
  
I agree never to publish any additional information to the SQLite website (by CVS, email, scp, FTP, or any other means) unless that information is an original work of authorship by me or is derived from prior published versions of SQLite. I agree never to copy and paste code into the SQLite code base from other sources. I agree never to publish on the SQLite website any information that would violate a law or breach a contract.
